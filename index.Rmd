Three words to describe me: passionate, analytical and gregarious.

I like to build things that meaningfully assist those around me. Currently I work with senior management both technically and non-technically to maximize content and library value in the Worldwide Television and Digital Distribution group at Lionsgate.

My bachelors degree (in Economics) is from California State University-Northridge, where I also received a minor in Philosophy. Throughout college, I worked a variety of jobs that include tutoring economics, selling women's shoes, jewelry and handbags at Nordstrom, and advising/translating for international students from Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries in the Intensive English Program.

I have founded programs at META+LAB (CSUN) and Nordstrom, among other projects which can be viewed [here]. I also conduct social and economic research which can be viewed [here].
