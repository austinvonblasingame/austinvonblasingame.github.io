Three words to describe me: passionate, analytical and gregarious.

I enjoy building things that are functional and facilitative. Currently I work with senior management both technically and non-technically to maximize content and library value in the Worldwide Television and Digital Distribution group at Lionsgate.

My bachelors degree (in Economics) is from California State University-Northridge, where I also received a minor in Philosophy. Throughout college, I worked a variety of jobs that included tutoring economics, marketing at a student-led web development agency, selling women's shoes, jewelry and handbags, interning at Lionsgate and Nordstrom, and advising/translating for international students from Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries.

Some of my past business and research ventures can be viewed in other tabs.
